Hi there


I’ve just finished [_**Machine Learning course**_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/) and I’m a little excited about this


## Thank you Coursera

First of writing about the course or myself, I’ve to thanks Coursera to accept my aid for financial.

The time I’d seen the approval email, I got happier than any time and I hope they do me a favor one more time in the future

## My blief in learning


> Learn from scratch

## Overall thought about this course


This course was published first in 2006 and its kind of pretty old for these days’ purpose but… If you like to learn the mathematical fundamental of machine learning discourse is one of the best available courses out there.


I had a course in my university about artificial intelligence and in that course, Dr Mohammad Omiid, mentioned a book which was written many years ago I think before 2000.


Maybe that's a little pretty old but this course by Andrew Ng is kind of better than that book and I have to admit that you will get familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning a little bit more.


If I could, I would apply for another course offered by coursera and introduced by Andrew Ng which is more related to deep learning. There is a course in Coursera as well


Thesedays, there are many different modules written by expertise to-do machine learning tasks more easier and with a less information and knowledge!


So think about this a little the more, if you would like to get more familiar with machine learning mathematical fundamentals this is one of the greatest courses available but if you like to learn about machine learning and and write code in Python or any other programming languages without great knowledge of mathematical fundamentals you have to go for other courses available


**Conclusion:**
Based on recent works on machine learning models mostly based on python, maybe it's better to go for a course to learn machine learning in Python


## whats next


I am involved with another machine learning course offered by Fun-Mooc whitch I started recenetly.


It's mostly about scikit-learn and how to work with data using scikit learn in Python.


My background knowledge in machine learning gathered from Coursera ML course, AI course in university and other sources, is really helpful in this scikit learn course.


I will apply for _Deep Learning Specialization_ offered by Coursera in the future, and I really hope they approve my aid for financial. The course needs 5 month to complete as Coursera mentioned, I think thats a great 5 month
