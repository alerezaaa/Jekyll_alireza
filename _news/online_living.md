{: .block-tip }

- **Cloudflare Pages** (`cf` subdomains) is based on Cloudflare CDN
- **Google's Firebase** (`fb` subdomains) is based on Google Cloud CDN
- **Netlify** (`nf` subdomains) is based on multi-CDN (as mentioned in [bejamas](https://bejamas.io/compare): _Google Cloud (GCP), AWS, Digital Ocean, Yandex, Rackspace Cloud_)
- **Vercel** (`vc` subdomains) is based on multi-CDN as well (as mentioned in [bejamas](https://bejamas.io/compare): _Google Cloud (GCP), AWS_)

Use these subdomains (`cf`, `fb`, `nf` and `vc`) before each website domain (eg. `vc.blog.alirezad.ir`) to connect to specified company network


example:

- **My website** (you are visitng now):
  - [Cloudflare](https://cf.alirezad.ir)
  - [Firebase](https://fb.alirezad.ir)
  - [Netlify](https://nf.alirezad.ir)
  - [Vercel](https://vc.alirezad.ir)
- **My Persian blog**:
  - [Cloudflare](https://cf.note.alirezad.ir)
  - [Netlify](https://nf.note.alirezad.ir)
  - [Vercel](https://vc.note.alirezad.ir)
